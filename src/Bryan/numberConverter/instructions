attempted to complete the bonus exercises on the curriculum to convert a base 10 num to it's hexadecimal and binary equivalent

through research it seemed there was a solution in parsing the valueOf a string and including the radix as a second parameter

I would continually get exceptions and errors

I tried changing the input data types,
        changing the output data types,
        changing the location of the methods,
        and
        tried casting to different data types all to no avail.

I then found a very simple solution in converting the input int to a string with a specific radix that corresponded to
the target base value.

Using this built in functionality, we are now easily able to convert base 10 numbers into their equivalent target base numbers
using a minimal amount of code.
